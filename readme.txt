The other song.asm file in this repo is written in x86 assembly, meaning that it will need to
be assembled on an x86 hardware (or a virtulized x86 machine). After it is assembled a .obj file
and a song.exe song will be generated. In order to play the scales in the program, run the 
resulting song.exe.

It's worth noting that only the 1/8 and 1/4 notes are used in the scales demo'd here, but there 
is code for half and full length notes as well. That can be used if this code is pulled to me 
modified. 

If there is confusiong about the mechanics of the code, please refer to the extensive commenting
inside the song.asm file.
